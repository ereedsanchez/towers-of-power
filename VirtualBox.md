#VirtualBox
VM VirtualBox is free and open-source software developed by Oracle Corporation. It supports the creation and management of guest virtual machines. In other words it allows you to run other operating systems on your device. This is especially helpful when working with software that is best compatible with Linux, which is often true for the type of work we do.


It can be installed on a number of host operating systems, including: Linux, OS X, Windows, Solaris, etc.
